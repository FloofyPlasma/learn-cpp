# History of C++
C++ was created by **Bjarne Stroustrup** at **Bell Labs** in **1979** as an extension of C. Originally called **"C with Classes"**, it introduced object-oriented programming features to C. In **1982**, it was officially renamed C++. Over time, multiple versions of the language have been standardized, with major releases including:
- **C++98 (1998)** - First standardization.
- **C++03 (2003)** - Minor bug fixes.
- [**C++11 (2011)**](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/11) - Major update introducing auto, smart pointers, lambda functions, move semantics, and more.
- **[C++14 (2014)](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/14)** - Minor improvements.
- [**C++17 (2017)**](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/17) - Enhancements like `std::optional`, structured bindings, and parallel algorithms.
- [**C++20 (2020)**](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/20) - Additions such as concepts, coroutines, and modules.
- [**C++23 (2023)**](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/23) - Further refinements with new library features.
# Features of C++
C++ is a **[multi-paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm)** language that supports:
1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
2. **Procedural Programming** – Supports traditional C-style functions and structures.
3. **Generic Programming** – Supports templates for writing reusable code.
4. **Low-Level Memory Manipulation** – Pointers, manual memory management via `new` and `delete`.
5. **High Performance** – Unlike interpreted languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript), C++ is compiled into machine code, making it fast.
6. **Standard Template Library (STL)** – Provides efficient implementations of data structures (vectors, maps) and algorithms.
7. **Multi-threading Support** – `std::thread` and related synchronization primitives.
8. **RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)** – Helps manage resources like memory, files, and sockets.

# Compilation Process in C++
C++ follows a **multi-step compilation process:**
1. **Preprocessing**
	- Handles `#include`, `#define`, and macro related keywords.
	- Generates an expanded source file.
2. **Compilation**
	- Translates the preprocessed-code into assembly.
	- Assembles the assembled code into machine code (`.o` file).
3. Linking
	- Combines object files and resolves dependencies.
	- Produces the final executable/library.
An example way of compiling C++ using `clang` would be:
```bash
clang -o my_program my_program.cpp
```
# Basic Tools Needed for C++ Development
To write, compile, and run C++ programs, you'll need the following tools:
### 1. Compiler
A **C++ compiler** converts C++ code into machine code. Some options are:
- [**GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)**](https://gcc.gnu.org/) - Available on Linux, Windows (via MinGW), and macOS.
- [**Clang**](https://clang.llvm.org/) - High-performance compiler, commonly used with LLVM.
- [**MSVC (Microsoft Visual C++)**](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - Comes with Visual Studio, optimized for Windows development.
### 2. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Text Editors
IDEs provide code editing, compilation, debugging, and project management in one package.
- **Visual Studio (Recommended for Windows)**
	- Includes MSVC compiler.
	- Debugging and IntelliSense.
- **Visual Studio Code**
	- Lightweight editor with extensions for C++ development.
	- Works with GCC, Clang, or MSVC.
- **Xcode (For macOS)**
	- Includes Clang and SDKs for macOS/iOS.
### 3. Build Systems and Package Managers
- **CMake** - Cross-platform build system for managing project builds.
- **Make** - Commonly used on Unix/Linux to automate build processes.
- **vcpkg / Conan** - Package managers for managing C++ libraries.
### 4. Debugging Tools
- **GDB (GNU Debugger)** - Debugging tool for GCC.
- **LLDB** - Debugger for Clang and LLVM.
- **WinDbg** - Debugging tool for Windows applications.
- **Visual Studio Debugger** - Comes with Visual Studio.
### 5. Version Control
- **Git** - Version control system for tracking code changes and collaboration.
- **GitHub / GitLab / Bitbucket** - Hosting services for Git repositories.
