# Introduction
Conditional statements allow a program to make decisions based on conditions. In C++, decision making is done using:
- **`if` and `else`** - for checking conditions and executing different code blocks.
- **`switch-case`** - for handling multiple possible values of a single variable.
- **Nested conditions** - for handling more complex logic within conditions.
# If-Else Statements
The `if` statement checks whether a conditions is `true` or `false`. If it's `true`, the code inside the `if` block executes. If it's `false`, the code in the `else` block (if present) executes instead.
### a. Basic If Statement
```cpp
int num = 10;

if (num > 0) { // Checks if num is postive
	std::cout << "The number is positive." << std::endl
}

return 0;
```
- If `num > 0` is `true`, the message prints.
- If `num` is not greater than 0, nothing happens.
### b. If-Else Statement
```cpp
int num = -5;

if (num > 0) {
    std::cout << "Positive number" << std::endl;
} else {
    std::cout << "Non-positive number" << std::endl;
}
```
- If the condition `num > 0` is `false`, the `else` block executes.
### c. Else-If Ladder
When multiple conditions need to be checked, use an `else-if` ladder.
```cpp
int num = 0;

if (num > 0) {
    std::cout << "Positive number" << std::endl;
} else if (num < 0) {
    std::cout << "Negative number" << std::endl;
} else {
    std::cout << "Number is zero" << std::endl;
}
```
- Conditions are checked in order.
- As soon as a condition is `true`, its block executes, and the rest are ignored.
# Nested If Statements
An `if` statement can be placed inside another `if` to create **nested conditions**.
```cpp
int num = 15;

if (num > 0) {
    std::cout << "Positive number" << std::endl;
    if (num % 2 == 0) {
        std::cout << "Even number" << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Odd number" << std::endl;
    }
}
```
- The outer `if` checks if `num` is positive.
- The inner `if` checks if `num` is even or odd.
# Switch-Case Statement
The `switch` statement is used to execute different blocks of code based on the value of a variable. It is useful when there are multiple specific cases to handle.
### a. Syntax of Switch
Each `case` represents a possible value of the expression. The `break` statement prevents execution from falling through to the next case.
```cpp
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // Code block for value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // Code block for value2
        break;
    default:
        // Code block if none of the cases match
}
```
### b. Example of Switch-Case
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int choice;

    std::cout << "Enter a number (1-3): ";
    std::cin >> choice;

    switch (choice) {
        case 1:
            std::cout << "You selected option 1" << std::endl;
            break;
        case 2:
            std::cout << "You selected option 2" << std::endl;
            break;
        case 3:
            std::cout << "You selected option 3" << std::endl;
            break;
        default:
            std::cout << "Invalid choice!" << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
- If the user enters `1` it prints `"You selected option 1"`, and so on.
- If they enter a number outside `1-3` the `default` case runs.
### c. Switch Without Break (Fall-through Behavior)
If a `break` is omitted, execution continues into the next case.
```cpp
int num = 2;

switch (num) {
    case 1:
        std::cout << "One ";
    case 2:
        std::cout << "Two ";
    case 3:
        std::cout << "Three ";
}
```
**Output:**
```
Two Three
```
Since case `2` matches, it executes, but because there is no `break`, it continues into case `3`.
# When to Use If-Else vs. Switch

| Condition                                      | Use If-Else | Use Switch-Case               |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Comparing ranges (e.g., `x > 10`)**          | ✅           | ❌                             |
| **Checking multiple specific values**          | ✅           | ✅                             |
| **Handling boolean conditions (`true/false`)** | ✅           | ❌                             |
| **When performance is critical**               | ❌           | ✅ (faster for multiple cases) |
