# Basic Syntax
- **Structure of a Program:**
	A basic C++ program includes the preprocessor directives, a main function, and statements terminated by semicolons. For example:
	```cpp
	#include <iostream>

	int main() {
	    std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl;

	    return 0;
	}
	```
- **Comments:**
	- **Single-line comments** start with `//`.
	- **Multi-line comments** are enclosed between `/*` and `*/`.
- **Semicolons and Braces**:
	Every statement ends with a semicolon (`;`), and blocks of code are grouped using curly braces `{}`.
# Variables and Data Types
### a. Declaring Variables
- **Declaration and Initialization:**
	Variables are declared by specifying a data type followed by a name. Optionally, you can initialize them at the time of declaration.
	```cpp
	int age;        // Declaration without initialization
	int count = 10; // Declaration with initialization
	```
### b. Common Data Types
- **Integers (`int`):**
	Used for whole numbers. You can use `short`, `long`, and `unsigned` for different ranges and storage sizes.
- **Floating Point Numbers (`float` and `double`):**
	For numbers with a fractional part, or a decimal place.
	- `float`: Typically 32-bit.
	- `double`: Typically 64-bit, offering more precision.
- **Characters (`char`):**
	Represent single characters using single quotes.
- **Booleans (`bool`):**
	Represents truth values: `true` or `false`.
	```cpp
	int number = 42;
	float temperature = 36.6f;
	double price = 99.98;
	char letter = 'A';
	bool isValid = true;
	```
	
# Variable Scope
- **Definition:**
	The scope of a variable defines the region of the program where the variable is accessible.
### a. Local Scope
- **Local Variables:**
	Variables declared within a function or a block `{}` are local to that block and cannot be accessed outside it.
	```cpp
	int main() {
		int x = 10; // 'x' is local to main()
		
		{
			int y = 5; // 'y' is only accessible within these braces
		}
		
		y = 3; // Error: Use of undeclared identifier 'y'
	
		return 0;
	}
	```
- **Variable Shadowing:**
	Shadowing occurs when a variable declared in an inner scope has the same name as one in an outer scope. In this case, the inner variable "shadows" the outer one, meaning that within the inner scope, the outer variable is not accessible.
	```cpp
	int main() {
	    int x = 10; // Outer 'x'
	    
	    {
	        int x = 5; // This 'x' shadows the outer 'x'
	        std::cout << x << std::endl; // Outputs 5, not 10
	    }
	    
	    std::cout << x << std::endl; // Outputs 10
	    
	    return 0;
	}
	```
### b. Global Scope
- **Global Variables:**
	Declared outside of all functions, these variables are accessible from any part of the program after their declaration.
	```cpp
	int globalValue = 100; // Global variable

	int main() {
		std::cout << globalValue >> std::endl; // 100

		return 0;
	}
	```
- **Best Practices:**
	While global variables can be useful, their extensive use can lead to code that is harder to maintain and debug. Use them judiciously.
