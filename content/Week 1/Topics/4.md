# Introduction
Loops are essential for repeating a block of code multiple times. In C++, the most common loops are **for loops**, **while loops**, and **nested loops**.

# For Loops
A **for loop** is ideal when the number of iterations is known ahead of time. Its syntax combines initialization, a condition, and an update expression in a single line.
### Example
```cpp
// Print numbers from 1 to 5
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    std::cout << "Iteration " << i << std::endl;
}
```
In this example:
- **Initialization:** `int i = 1` sets the starting value.
- **Condition**: `i <= 5` determines when the loop stops.
- **Update:** `i++` increments the counter after each iteration.
# While Loops
A **while loop** is used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand. The loop continues as long as a given condition is true.
### Example
```cpp
int i = 1;

// Print numbers from 1 to 5 using a while loop
while (i <= 5) {
	std::cout << "Iteration " << i << std::endl;
	i++; // Update the condition variable
}
```
In this example:
- The condition `i <= 5` is checked before each iteration.
- The loop terminates when `i` exceeds 5.
# Nested Loops
**Nested Loops** are loops placed inside another loop. They are useful for working with multi-dimensional data structures like matrices or creating patterns.
### Example
```cpp
// Print a 5x5 grid of asterisks
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {         // Outer loop for rows
    for (int j = 1; j <= 5; j++) {     // Inner loop for columns
        std::cout << "* ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;  // Move to the next row after finishing a row
}
```
In this example:
- The **outer loop** runs 5 times (once for each row).
- The **inner loop** runs 5 times per iteration of the outer row, printing columns.
- The result is a grid (or matrix) of asterisks.
