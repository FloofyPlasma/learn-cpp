# Exercise 4: Multiplication Table Generator
### Objective:
Create a C++ program that demonstrates looping mechanisms by generating a multiplication table. The program should use loops to iterate through rows and columns, and print the multiplication results in a formatted table.
### Instructions:
1. **Main Function Setup:**
	- Start by including the necessary header (`<iostream>`).
	- In the `main()` function, prompt the user to input a range for the multiplication table.
2. **Using Loops:**
	- Use **nested loops** to generate and display the multiplication table.
	- The outer loop should iterate over rows (from 1 to the range).
	- The inner loop should iterate over columns (from 1 to the range).
	- Each cell in the table should display the product of the current row and column numbers.
3. **Formatting Output:**
	- Format the output so the table is easy to read.
	- Hint: Use a tab character `\t`, to evenly space between numbers.
4. **Commenting:**
	- Include comments in your code explaining each section, especially where loops are used.
### Example Starter code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int range;
    
    // Prompt user for the table range
    std::cout << "Enter the range for the multiplication table (e.g., 10 for a 10x10 table): ";
    std::cin >> range;
    
    // Generate multiplication table using nested loops
    std::cout << "Multiplication Table (1 to " << range << "):" << std::endl;
    for (int i = 1; i <= range; i++) {       // Outer loop for rows
        for (int j = 1; j <= range; j++) {   // Inner loop for columns
            std::cout << (i * j) << "\t";         // Calculate and display product, using a tab for spacing
        }
        std::cout << std::endl; // Move to the next row
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```
### Task:
Complete the above exercise by writing your own version of the program. Experiment by:
- Changing the table range.
- Adding additional formatting to the table to make it more readable.
- Using different types of loops (e.g., while loops) if you wish to explore further looping mechanisms.
