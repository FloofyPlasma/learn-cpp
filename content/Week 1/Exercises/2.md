# Exercise 2: Exploring Variables, Scope and Lifetime in C++
### Objective:
Create a C++ program that demonstrates the following:
1. **Variable Declaration and Manipulation:**
	- Declare variables of different types: `int`, `float`, `char`, and `boolean`.
	- Initialize these variables with values.
	- Perform some basic operations (e.g., arithmetic on integers/floats, changing the value of a variable, etc.).
2. **Scope and Lifetime:**
	- Create a nested block that declares its own local variables.
	- Demonstrate how variable scope works by printing values from different scopes.
	- Include an example of variable shadowing where a variable declared in an inner block has the same name as one in an outer block. Show how the inner variable temporarily "hides" the outer variable.
### Instructions:
1. **Main Function Setup:**
	- Start by including the necessary header (`<iostream>`).
	- In the `main()` function, declare an initialize variables:
		- An integer (e.g., `int age = 25;`)
		- A float (e.g., `float temperature = 98.6f;`)
		- A char (e.g., `char grade = 'A';)
		- A boolean (e.g., `bool isPassed = true;`)
	- Print the values of these variables to the console.
2. **Arithmetic Operations:**
	- Perform at least one arithmetic operation using your integer and float variables. Print the results.
3. **Exploring Scope:**
	- Create a nested block (using `{ }`) within the `main()` function.
	- Inside this block, declare a new variable with the same name as one declared in the outer scope (this is shadowing). For instance:
	```cpp
	int age = 30; // This 'age' shadows the outer 'age'
	```
	- Print the value of the shadowed variable inside the block and then print the value of the original variable outside the block to observe the difference.
4. **Commenting:**
	- Include comments in your code explaining each section, especially where scope and shadowing occur.
### Example Starter Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Variable declarations and initializations
    int age = 25;
    float temperature = 98.6f;
    char grade = 'A';
    bool isPassed = true;

    // Display initial values
    std::cout << "Initial values:" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Age: " << age << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Temperature: " << temperature << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Grade: " << grade << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Passed: " << std::boolalpha << isPassed << std::endl;

    // Basic arithmetic operations
    int newAge = age + 5;
    float newTemperature = temperature - 2.0f;
    std::cout << "After arithmetic operations:" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "New Age: " << newAge << std::endl;
    std::cout << "New Temperature: " << newTemperature << std::endl;

    // Demonstrate variable scope and shadowing
    std::cout << "Exploring scope with shadowing:" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Outer age before shadowing: " << age << std::endl;
    {
        int age = 30; // This 'age' shadows the outer 'age'
        std::cout << "Inner age (shadowing outer age): " << age << std::endl;
    }
    std::cout << "Outer age after inner block: " << age << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
### Task:
Complete the above exercise by writing your own program. Experiment by changing the values and operations, and add additional nested blocks if you wish to further explore variable scope and lifetime.
