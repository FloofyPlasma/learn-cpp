# Week 1: Introduction to C++ and Basics
##### Day 1: Overview of C++
- [[Week 1/Topics/1|Topics]]: History, features, similarities and differences from other languages, compilation process, basic tools needed.
- [[Week 1/Exercises/1|Exercises]]: Write a simple "Hello, World!" program, compile and run it using Visual Studio.
##### Day 2: Syntax and Variables
- [[Week 1/Topics/2|Topics]]: Basic syntax, variables, data types (integers, floats, chars, booleans), variable scope.
- [[Week 1/Exercises/2|Exercises]]: Declare and manipulate variables of different types, explore scope and lifetime.
##### Day 3: Control Structures
- [[Week 1/Topics/3|Topics]]: Conditional statements (if, else), switch-case, nested conditions.
- [[Week 1/Exercises/3|Exercises]]: Implement a decision-making program, create a simple calculator using switch-case.
##### Day 4: Loops
- Topics: For loops, while loops, nested loops.
- Exercises: Practice looping mechanisms, create a multiplication table generator.
##### Day 5: Debugging Basics
- Topics: Using Visual Studio debugger, setting breakpoints, stepping through code, inspecting variables.
- Exercises: Debug simple programs with introduced errors, explore watch and call stack windows.
# Week 2: Intermediate Concepts
##### Day 1: Functions
- Topics: Function definition, parameters, return values, function overloading.
- Exercises: Create functions for calculations and output, implement overloaded functions.
##### Day 2: Arrays and Pointers
- Topics: Array declaration, pointer basics, pointer arithmetic, dynamic arrays.
- Exercises: Manipulate arrays and pointers, implement dynamic memory allocation.
##### Day 3: References and Const Correctness
- Topics: Differences between pointers and references, importance of const, avoiding accidental modifications.
- Exercises: Implement functions using references and const correctly, practice with const pointers.
##### Day 4: Advanced Control Structures
- Topics: Break, continue; nested control structures, recursion.
- Exercises: Implement complex logic flows, create recursive functions for factorial and Fibonacci calculations.
# Week 3: Data Structures
##### Day 1: Structs
- Topics: Declaring structs, initializing members, struct arrays.
- Exercises: Create a struct for data representation, implement a simple address book program.
##### Day 2: Linked Lists (Singly/Doubly)
- Topics: Node structure, insertion, deletion, traversal, doubly linked lists.
- Exercises: Implement linked list operations, create a menu-driven program for list operations.
##### Day 3: Stacks and Queues
- Topics: Stack (LIFO) and Queue (FIFO) principles, array and linked list implementation.
- Exercises: Implement stack push/pop, queue enqueue/dequeue.
# Week 4: Object-Oriented Programming
##### Day 1: Classes and Objects
- Topics: Class definition, object instantiation, member functions, encapsulation.
- Exercises: Create a simple class with methods, implement getter and setter functions.
##### Day 2: Constructors and Destructors
- Topics: Default constructors, parameterized constructors, destructor usage.
- Exercises: Implement classes with constructors/destructors, create a class that manages dynamic memory.
##### Day 3: Inheritance
- Topics: Base and derived classes, inheritance types, access specifiers.
- Exercises: Create a hierarchy of classes, demonstrate function overriding.
##### Day 4: Polymorphism and Virtual Functions
